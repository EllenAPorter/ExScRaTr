\section{Conclusion}
We have taken the first steps in designing and implementing a ray algorithm for exascale.  Although we do not have exascale hardware yet, we are hoping to emulate our implementation on todays systems.  Integrating our CnC graph file with Embree to produce a fully funcitonal distributed ray tracer will be the focus of our future work, but we also hope to explore other aspecs of exascale such as hybrid systems and examine how they may impact our design.
