\abstract{ %
  Exascale computers, defined as being capable of performing at least
  one exaflop ($10^{18}$ floating point operations per second) are
  anticipated to emerge in the next several years. Reaching this scale
  of computation will require hardware and software changes for
  high-performance computing (HPC). Applications will need to adapt as
  the architecture of supercomputers change. Some studies suggest
  ``communication avoiding'' algorithms might be the most performant
  design for future systems. This has created an interest in the
  development of scalable visualization algorithms and techniques.

  In this paper we explore the impact exascale hardware will have on
  programming models and application design. We then look at one
  specific model, Concurrent Collections (CnC), and explore how we can
  use it and Intel's Embree Ray Tracing Engine to build a scalable ray
  tracing system with an emphasis on communication avoidance and
  extension for exascale. As exascale hardware does not yet exist,
  this work is speculative, but we hope it serves as a foundation for
  future discussion and work. %
