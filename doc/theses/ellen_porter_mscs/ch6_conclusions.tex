\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have taken the first steps in designing and implementing a ray tracing
algorithm for exascale.  Although we do not have exascale hardware yet, we have 
executed our implementation on today's systems, integrating the task-based 
library, CnC, with the ray tracing kernel library, Embree.  Our ray tracer does
not support all features of common ray tracers, we believe it provides a basis
that can be extended in future work.  We have shown the viability of a
communication-avoiding ray tracer and look forward to exploring aspects of
exascale such as hybrid systems to examine how they may impact our design.
